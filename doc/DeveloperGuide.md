1. Open Eclipse
2. Click `File` > `Import`
3. Click `General` > `Existing Projects into Workspace` > `Next`
4. Click `Browse`, then locate the project's directory
5. Click `Finish`

## Testing

### System tests

**Windows**

1. Open a DOS window in the `test` folder
2. Run the `runtests.bat` script
3. If the script reports that there is no difference between `actual.txt` and `expected.txt`, 
   the test has passed.

**Mac/Unix/Linux**

1. Open a terminal window in the `test` folder
2. Run the `runtests.sh` script
3. If the script reports that there is no difference between `actual.txt` and `expected.txt`, 
   the test has passed.

### JUnit tests

* In Eclipse, right-click on the `test/java` folder and choose `Run as` > `JUnit Test`

### Troubleshooting test failures

* Problem: How do I examine the exact differences between `actual.txt` and `expected.txt`?<br>
  Solution: You can use a diff/merge tool with a GUI e.g. WinMerge (on Windows)
* Problem: The two files look exactly the same, but the test script reports they are different.<br>
  Solution: This can happen because the line endings used by Windows is different from Unix-based
  OSes. Convert the actual.txt to the format used by your OS using some [utility](https://kb.iu.edu/d/acux).
* Problem: Test fails during the very first time.<br>
  Solution: The output of the very first test run could be slightly different because the program
  creates a new storage file. Tests should pass from the 2nd run onwards.
  
### User Story 
* As a user, I would like to be able to edit an existing contact
* As a user, I would like to add multiple numbers for the same contact 

### Renaming an existing tag

* Essentially want to refactor the 'friend' tag into a 'buddy' tag
* In order to do this, find one reference to the friend tag, highlight it, then use 'Ctrl + Shift + G' to open up all references to object then change it to 'buddy' instead of 'friend'

### Non Functional Requirements

* The address book should store up to at least 2000 contacts
* The security level should be very good so others cannot hack into an address book
* The response time for retrieving all contacts should be less than 10ms
